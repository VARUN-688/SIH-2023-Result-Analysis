# SIH-23 Results Analysis: Insights from Batch 1 to Batch 5

## Description
The Smart India Hackathon (SIH) is a prestigious initiative fostering innovation and problem-solving among students across India. In this project, I've conducted an in-depth analysis of the SIH-23 results spanning Batch 1 to Batch 5. Leveraging Python, pandas, NumPy, and web scraping techniques, I've gathered and processed data from various sources to extract valuable insights.

## Key Features
- **Data Acquisition**: Utilized web scraping techniques to gather data from relevant websites and APIs.
- **Data Processing**: Employed Python, pandas, and NumPy to clean, preprocess, and analyze the collected data.
- **Visualization**: Created insightful visualizations using Power BI to present key findings and trends effectively.

## Objective
- Provide insights into the performance trends, project categories, and outcomes across different batches of SIH-23.
- Identify patterns and areas of improvement for future editions of the Smart India Hackathon.

## Repository Content
- Python scripts for data scraping, cleaning, and analysis.
- Jupyter notebooks containing detailed analysis and visualization code.
- Power BI reports for interactive visualization and exploration of the SIH-23 results.



## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Explore the Jupyter notebooks for detailed analysis and insights.
4. Interact with the Power BI reports for visual exploration of the SIH-23 results.
